# ðŸ”· Simple OOPs Implementation

This repository contains a basic and structured implementation of core **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** concepts, demonstrating how real-world systems can be designed using classes and objects.

## ðŸ§± Core OOP Principles Used

- âœ… **Encapsulation** â€“ Grouping data and methods within classes.
- âœ… **Inheritance** â€“ Sharing behaviors among classes in a hierarchy.
- âœ… **Polymorphism** â€“ Using method overloading and overriding.
- âœ… **Abstraction** â€“ Hiding internal logic and exposing only necessary features.


## ðŸ“¦ Features

- Modular and clean class structure
- Constructor usage for object creation
- Method overloading and overriding
- Use of access modifiers to enforce encapsulation
- Inheritance to reduce code duplication
- Use of abstract classes or interfaces (if applicable)
- A `Main` or `Driver` class to run and test the functionality

## ðŸŽ¯ Purpose

This repository is designed for:

- Beginners learning OOP
- Developers revising core OOP concepts
- Students preparing for coding interviews or academic projects
